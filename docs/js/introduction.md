# Asgardeo JS SDK

The Asgardeo JS SDK enables some core features required for api based authentication.

This SDK assists you in creating custom login flows directly within the applications themselves, without relying on browser redirects, thereby prioritizing user experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Register to Asgardeo and create an organization if you don't already have one](https://wso2.com/asgardeo/docs/get-started/create-asgardeo-account/). The organization name you choose will be referred to as `<org_name>` throughout this document.
- [Register a standard based application in Asgardeo to integrate your application with Asgardeo](https://wso2.com/asgardeo/docs/guides/applications/register-mobile-app/). You will obtain a `client_id` from Asgardeo for your application which will need to be embedded later for the SDK integration. Also note the redirect URI that you used to create the application, this is also required for the SDK integration.
- In the created application, go to the **Advanced** tab and [enable the application native authentication for your application](https://is.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/guides/authentication/add-application-native-login/#enable-app-native-authentication).
