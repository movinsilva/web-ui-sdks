# SignIn

The `SignIn` component provides sign-in forms as configured in the login flow of Asgardeo. When the `SignIn` component renders,
it initiates the sign-in process.

## Usage

First, import the `SignIn` component from the Asgardeo React SDK:

```ts
import { SignIn } from "@asgardeo/react";

<SignIn />
```

## Props

The `SignIn` component accepts the following props:

- `branding`: A string that specifies the branding preference for the sign-in form.

- `showLogo`: A boolean that determines whether the logo should be displayed on the sign-in form. If set to `false`, the logo will not be displayed. Defaults to `true`.

- `showFooter`: A boolean that determines whether the footer should be displayed on the sign-in form. If set to `false`, the footer will not be displayed. Defaults to `true`.

- `showSignUp`: A boolean that determines whether the signup link should be displayed on the sign-in form. If set to `true`, the signup link will be displayed. Defaults to `false`.

Here's an example of how to use these props:

```ts
<SignIn
    branding={{preference: { .. }}}
    showLogo={false}
    showFooter={false}
    showSignUp={true}
/>
```
